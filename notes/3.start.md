1. create the package.json
```
npm init -y
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

3. create webpack.config.js
If we run, npm webpack, so it will build and create dist folder, and this dist folder contains only the main.js (minified) file. In order to attach it with index.html all we need is HtmlWebpackPlugin

```
module.exports = {
  mode:"development",
  devServer: {
    port: '3001',
  },
  plugins: [
    <!-- This plugin is to add index.html in dist folder -->
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      title: 'Product App',
      template: 'public/index.html',
    }),
  ],
};
```

4. Edit the package json file and add start attribute with value as 'webpack server'
Note: webpack will bundle the changes and server will run these changes on webpack-dev-server.
```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack serve",
  },
```
5. Run the server
http://localhost:3001/
```
npm start
```
